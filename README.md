## Hi there, I'm Fredrik ðŸ‘‹
During the day, I work for [SEB Group](https://github.com/sebgroup) as a quant developer/analyst within market risk and model validation, focusing on derivatives pricing. I mainly contribute to the development of our forks of the [Open Source Risk Engine](https://github.com/OpenSourceRisk/Engine) and [QuantLib](https://github.com/lballabio/QuantLib). I also build integrations to front office and risk systems with Python and SQL.

At night, I'm a coding enthusiast who spends his time doing challenges on HackerRang and LeetCode.
